Welcome to Kris's Metal Shim Adder app!

This app was designed for the user to be able to add metal shims together, as well as give them numerous other tools to help check things while
they are calculating the total value of it all.

Please refer to the help button located on the app for more instruction, and reach out to kristopher.clancy@cuw.edu if you have anymore questions! 

Thanks, and enjoy the app! :)
